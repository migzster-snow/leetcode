# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. I use this repo to track my progress, practice algorithms and data structures, and refine my coding skills.

## 📂 Structure

Solutions are organised by **language** and then by problem number and name. Each language has its own folder (e.g., `cpp/`, `java/`, `python/`, etc.). Filenames follow the format:

```
<problem-number>-<problem-name>.<extension>
```

For example:

```
leetcode/
├── cpp/
│   ├── 0001-two-sum.cpp
│   ├── 0002-add-two-numbers.cpp
│   └── 0003-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.cpp
├── java/
│   ├── 0001-two-sum.java
│   └── 0002-add-two-numbers.java
├── python/
│   ├── 0001-two-sum.py
│   └── 0002-add-two-numbers.py
...
```

## 🛠️ Languages Used

* **C++** (`cpp/`)
* **Java** (`java/`)
* **Python** (`python/`)
* (and more in the future)

## 🎯 Goals

* Consistently solve LeetCode problems to strengthen problem-solving skills.
* Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code in multiple languages.
* Build a reference for future coding interviews.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/migzster-snow/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```
2. Navigate to your desired language folder:

   ```bash
   cd cpp   # or java, python, etc.
   ```
3. Compile or run the solution depending on the language.

   * **C++**:

     ```bash
     g++ 0001-two-sum.cpp -o two_sum
     ./two_sum
     ```
   * **Java**:

     ```bash
     javac 0001-two-sum.java
     java TwoSum
     ```
   * **Python**:

     ```bash
     python3 0001-two-sum.py
     ```
