## 📂 Structure

Solutions are organised by problem number and name. Each solution is implemented in **C++**. Filenames follow the format:

```
<problem-number>-<problem-name>.cpp
```

For example:

```
leetcode/
├── 0001-two-sum.cpp
├── 0002-add-two-numbers.cpp
├── 0003-longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.cpp
...
```

## 🛠️ Language Used

- **C++** (only)

## 🎯 Goals

- Consistently solve LeetCode problems to strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Practice writing clean, efficient, and well-documented C++ code.
- Build a reference for future coding interviews.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/migzster-snow/leetcode.git
   cd leetcode
   ```
2. Open any problem solution file and compile it with g++ (or your preferred C++ compiler).
   ```bash
   g++ 0001-two-sum.cpp -o two_sum
   ./two_sum
   ```
